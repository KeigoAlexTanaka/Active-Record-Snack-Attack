# What _is_ Active Record???

Active Record is what we're going to use to manage our database for our Rails app. (Like `pg-promise` but extremely way cooler.) It comes built in to Rails, but you can also use it with Sinatra.

Active Record is what's called an ORM, or **O**bject **R**elational **M**apping (tool). It allows us to represent all of the information in our database as objects. 

Here's a sneak peak of what that looks like.

Instead of writing the following SQL query: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM snacks;
```

We can just write this:

```rb
Snack.all()
```

Pretty cool, right? (The _really_ cool shit is yet to come.)

# Building a Snack Attack app!!!!

### Creating an app and a database

Let's start by creating a new Rails app:

`rails new SnackAttack --database=postgresql -G`

We're telling Rails to create a new SnackAttack app with a postgres database, and not to initiate a git repository immediately. 

You should add and commit everything at this point.

Then, create the database by running `rails db:create`. Rails knows what your database should be named
